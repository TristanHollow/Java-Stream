          contribute to the global world and practice the core values of the
          school: respect, tolerance & inclusion, and excellence.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our mission is to develop students with active and creative minds, a

            <h4>What makes Mzamomtsha Primary School unique?</h4>
            <p>
              Mzomomtsha is a School where every child means something.
              Mzamomtsha is a rich cultured school that focus on acedemy and
              music.Both the academic and psychological needs of a child must be
              nurtured if total and continuous learning is to take place. The
              best learning environment is one that encourages cooperation
              rather than individual competition. All children are gifted and
              are entitled to be treated accordingly. Since parents are the
              primary teachers of their children, it is only through the
              cooperative efforts of both home and school that children can
              receive the best education possible.
