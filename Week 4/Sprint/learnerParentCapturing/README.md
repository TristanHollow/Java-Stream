## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA DEPENDENCIES` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-pack/blob/master/release-notes/v0.9.0.md#work-with-jar-files-directly).

## Overview
The task this program was created to accomplish, was to be able to get user input and store that input in a database. This is made to cater to 2 different users, namely 'parents' and 'learners'. The start of the program gives the current user a selection of being registered as a parent or learner, the next choice allows the user to either write new information for the current selection of the parent or learner table, or to read and print out the currently stored data for the selected type of user.
